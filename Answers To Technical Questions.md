**Q1.** How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

**Ans.**  I spent total 3 hours in this test. If I had more time, then i would cover below test scenarios :
 - User must be able to add menu items in basket
 - User must be able to search restaurant menu items by category
 - Logged in User must be able to checkout
 - Logged out User must sign in to check out

**Q2.** What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

**Ans.** Interesting trend in test automation:
 - AI and Machine learning based test automation tools: It will help report automated test runs and analysis
 - Continuous testing

**Q3.** How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

**Ans.**  I would implement test automation in a legacy application through following steps:
1. Analyse the application, determine the functional areas that are easier to automate, find the functional areas that are most critical.
2. Understanding the interaction of different modules with each other
3. Evaluate testing frameworks, if it is a web application then evaluate tools which access the DOM 
4. Brainstorm with team (developers, product owners)
5. Create test workflows


**Q4.** How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

**Ans.** I would improve customer experience of JUST EAT site through following ways:
1. By making site more interactive, UI is not very impressive. The font-styles and color  for the website have a huge impact on user experience.
2. By adding good quality optimized images on restaurant menu page increase the visibility and encourage user to explore site.
3. For customised products in restaurant menu, user is not able to edit/delete the sub-items once selected in product dialog(for ex: in case of pizza).Therefore, user should be able to add/edit order with few clicks.
